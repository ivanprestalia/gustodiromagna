 * Make sure we have a minimum PHP version which can run this basic plugin bootup code.
 *
 * This file deliberately contains very simple PHP code which will even run on ancient PHP versions (7.0, released all
 * the way back in 2015). If your server does not even meet this minimum, we'll just not load the plugin to avoid a
 * PHP error which would end up disabling the plugin altogether.
 *
 * Why do that? It's possible you installed the plugin running a modern PHP version, then you screwed up your server
 * configuration so that it runs an ancient PHP version, or tried to run a CLI script with an ancient PHP version. This
 * kind of simple mistake should not result in your backup solution being permanently deactivated by WordPress with
 * barely a misleading email blaming our software. That's why!

/**
 * Wrapping everything in a try-catch block to avoid automatic plugin deactivation.
 *
 * WordPress has this annoying feature which deactivates a plugin if there is an exception thrown. Normally this is a
 * good protection against badly written plugins. However, it will also disable plugins when unforeseen problems outside
 * the plugin's control occur, e.g. the database connection goes away while the plugin is initialising.
 *
 * Wrapping everything in a try-catch allows us to not load the plugin **for this request only**, in hope that the next
 * request will see the environmental defect fixed.
